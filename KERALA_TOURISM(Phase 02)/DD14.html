    <p>A beautiful rain forest near Konnakad, the Kottancheri Hills is a part of the Western Ghats in Kasaragod district and an extension of Ranipuram wildlife sanctuary. The place is 30kms north-east of Kanhangad. The picnic centre at Kottancheri Hills makes it a favorite among the travellers. The hills are also ideal for trekking and are credited as trekkerâ€™s paradise. The nearness of the Talakaveri in the Brahmagiri mountain range of Kodaku adds to the charm of this place. The Forests of Kottancherry is packed with wildlife and merges with reserved forests of Kasaragod. Wild elephants, wild dogs, deer, wild pigs, rare birds, butterflies are all abundant here.

    <p>After reaching Ranipuram, start your trek from the DTPC guest house. Most of trek will be through dense shola forests. It will take you around 45 minutes to reach the top, where you will be greeted by huge boulders, picturesque views and gusty winds. The views from the top are often compared to the views one gets in Ooty, the popular hill station in Tamil Nadu. The hills showcase the beauty of the Western Ghats and make for a delightful short journey.</p>
