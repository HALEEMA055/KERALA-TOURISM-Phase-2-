    <p>One of the stunning beaches in Kerala, Kappad Beach is located around 16km from Kozhikode and is revered as one of the most important historical sites in Godâ€™s Own Country!

    <a href="#">Thusharagiri_water_falls</a>
    <p>Two streams originating from the Western Ghats meet here to form the Chalippuzha River. The river diverges into three waterfalls creating a snowy spray, which gives the name, 'Thusharagiri' a word which means the snow-capped mountain. Of the three waterfalls, the highest is the Thenpara, falling from an altitude of 75 metres (246 ft). The other two are the Erattumukku falls and Mazhavil Chattam falls.</p>
